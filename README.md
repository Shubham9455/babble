## Discription

 I have implemented Firebase 🔥 **Authentication** to authenticate the user on login or signup.
 
 Firebase 🔥 **Firestore** to make NoSQL document database that lets us easily store, sync, and query data of the cit chats. 🗣
 
 All the people logining in can have a group chat. 👨‍👦‍👦

 App is made simple, and with good UI. 🙂
